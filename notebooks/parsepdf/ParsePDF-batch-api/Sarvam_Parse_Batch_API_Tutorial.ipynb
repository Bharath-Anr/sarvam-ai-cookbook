        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Sarvam PARSE PDF Batch API** to process and extract structured data from multiple PDF files simultaneously. The Batch API allows you to upload a batch of PDFs, parse them, and retrieve their content in HTML format for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Instructions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Get Your Subscription Key:**\n",
        "   - Go to [dashboard.sarvam.ai](https://dashboard.sarvam.ai) and sign in to your account.\n",
        "   - Copy your **API Subscription Key** for authentication.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Set Up Google Colab Folders:**\n",
        "   - Create two folders in your Google Colab notebook:\n",
        "     - **`input/`**: This is where you'll upload your PDF files for batch processing.\n",
        "     - **`output/`**: The parsed files will be saved here, and you can download them after processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Upload Multiple PDF Files for Batch Processing:**\n",
        "   - Use the **Upload** button in Google Colab to upload all the PDF files you want to process into the **input/** folder.\n",
        "   - Make sure you upload your PDFs as a batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run the Script to Parse the PDFs:**\n",
        "   - The script will send the entire batch of uploaded PDF files to the **Sarvam Parse PDF Batch API**, process them, and save the parsed content in **HTML format** in the **output/** folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Download Processed Files:**\n",
        "   - Once the batch processing is completed, the parsed files will be saved in the **output/** folder. You can then download the processed HTML files from there.\n",
